During this week I researched different algorithms and ways of generating 2d dungeons. I initially wanted to create this project using C# but after learning how complicated cs-files are to compile and run without VS Code using only command-line interface, I decided to use python instead.


The project has progressed nicely, even though at the moment I only have a (hopefully good) plan.

I have learned about C# which was not necessary for this project, but also about different dungeon generating algorithms.

The hard part was to find out different algorithms to use and their time complexities, and to find their names since some algorithms I found were not named and there was no documentation linked to read more about them.


Next week I will get the basics of the program to work such as inputs (that will not do anything yet) and output and maybe the basic structure of the program so that I can test different parts of it.


I used about 8 hours during this week for learning the beforementioned things.
