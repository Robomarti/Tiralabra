I used wikipedia as a source. 
I tried perlin noise, but even though I feel like I copied the example perfectly, it still does not feel random. Probably because I am creating the cave with same coordinates every time.

random room placement is pretty immune to cellular automata smoothing, except when the rooms are close to each other.
random room placement not worth it

in the end normal randomness was best

I omitted perlin noise from coverage and lint, since I don't really use it in my application but I wanted to show it regardless in case anyone is curious about my progress.
